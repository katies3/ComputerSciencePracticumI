# ComputerSciencePracticumI
A comic book repository built as a three-month project. I contributed as a junior developer. For this project, I wrote the backend and frontend for adding and editing characters, wrote the backend and frontend of the search function for adding friends, and designed the styling for the entire site. 

## Comic Book Inventory System
In this project the team will build an inventorty system for an ever growing comic book collections. Users will be able to create accounts, sign-in, and add view their whole collection. If they are interested in seeing the details of a particular issue they will be able to select and see those details. They will also be able to add issues to their collection every week when they come out.
